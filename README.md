# MalDev Analyzer MCP

**Built for red teamers, by red teamers** - an MCP-powered assistant for malware development, OPSEC testing, and custom loader design during red team engagements.

MalDev Analyzer MCP is designed to help offensive security professionals and malware developers quickly evaluate Windows binaries for traits that may impact stealth, functionality, or OPSEC. Whether you're building a loader, refining an implant, or validating payload security posture, this tool provides fast, targeted insights.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **MCP Integration** â€“ Works with the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to interact directly with compatible AI assistants like Cursor.
- **Binary Trait Analysis** â€“ Identify patterns common in real-world malware and red team tooling.
- **OPSEC Checks** â€“ Spot traits that could raise detection risk during engagements.
- **Custom Loader Support** â€“ Designed with loader development workflows in mind.

# Motivation

As a red-teamer, time is a luxury.  
In real-world red team engagements, malware analysis and OPSEC checks often require juggling a patchwork of GUI tools â€” PE-Bear, Detect-It-Easy, Resource Hacker, YARA scanners, and more. Each demands manual clicks, constant context switching, and repetitive steps just to extract the handful of indicators you actually care about.

**MalDev Analyzer MCP** was built to eliminate that friction.  
By embedding a full suite of PE inspection, loader analysis, and OPSEC heuristics directly into your MCP-compatible IDE (like Cursor or Claudeâ€™s MCP mode), you can query and analyze binaries without leaving your workflow.

With MalDev Analyzer MCP you can:
- **Correlate** IAT entries vs. runtime strings to uncover IAT hiding & dynamic API resolution.
- **Classify** sections using known baselines, flag anomalies, and detect packer indicators (e.g., `.upx`, `.rsrc2`, `.textbss`).
- **Detect** real-world malicious traits like AMSI/ETW patch patterns, C2 framework indicators, embedded shellcode, or encrypted blobs.
- ...and **much more**.

By performing **contextual scoring** instead of raw dumping, you immediately know whether a finding is benign, suspicious, or likely malicious.

The goal: bridge the gap between *generic PE analysis* and **practical OPSEC testing** for loader and implant development - all inside an MCP workflow, without bouncing between multiple GUIs or command-line tools.

This means **faster turnarounds**, **less human error**, and **more focus on developing and refining your custom loaders** â€” not wrestling with a dozen disconnected tools.

## ðŸ›  Included Analysis Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **File Hashing** | Compute SHA-256 and MD5 hashes for quick identification. |
| **String Extraction** | Extract top ASCII/UTF-16 strings to quickly surface suspicious terms. |
| **Suspicious API Detection** | Flag WinAPI calls often used in malware development. |
| **C2 Framework Indicators** | Detect known C2 framework names embedded in binaries. |
| **Section Analysis** | Identify unusual or risky PE section names. |
| **Shannon Entropy** | Detect high-entropy data that may indicate encryption/packing. |
| **Import Table (IAT) Analysis** | Compare declared imports to discovered API usage to spot hiding/obfuscation. |
| **Export Table Analysis** | Highlight exports with suspicious keywords or patterns. |
| **PE Metadata Information** | Extract basic file metadata for further profiling. |
| **PE Sections Inspection** | Perform heuristic shellcode detection for raw blobs or embedded PE sections.  |

## ðŸ”§ Example MCP Queries
**Example queries you can ask through the MCP:**
- "Scan this file for suspicious API calls and potential IAT hiding"
- "Check this binary for section anomalies or known packer signatures"
- "Analyze this loader for C2 indicators and hardcoded framework names"
- "Extract the top suspicious strings from this executable"
- "Perform export table analysis on this file"
- "Check file hashes and entropy score"
- "Identify any suspicious persistence or injection-related APIs"
- "Run full OPSEC analysis on this loader for red team use"
