# MalDev Analyzer MCP

**Built for red teamers, by red teamers** - an MCP-powered assistant for malware development, OPSEC testing, and custom loader design during red team engagements.

MalDev Analyzer MCP is designed to help offensive security professionals and malware developers quickly evaluate Windows binaries for traits that may impact stealth, functionality, or OPSEC. Whether you're building a loader, refining an implant, or validating payload security posture, this tool provides fast, targeted insights.

# Why?

As a red-teamer - in real-world red team engagements, time is a luxury.
Most malware analysis and OPSEC checks require juggling a patchwork of GUI tools, including PE-Bear, Detect-It-Easy, Resource Hacker, and YARA scanners, among others. Each one demands manual clicks, context switching, and repetitive tasks just to extract the handful of indicators you care about.

**MalDev Analyzer MCP** was built to eliminate that friction.
By embedding a full suite of PE inspection, loader analysis, and OPSEC checks directly into your MCP-compatible IDE (like Cursor or Claude's MCP mode), you can query and analyze binaries without leaving your workflow.

Instead of:
- Opening a GUI
- Navigating menus
- Exporting intermediate results
- Manually correlating strings, IAT entries, entropy values, and section flags

Now you can now simply ask your MCP assistant to "Check this loader for suspicious API calls and section anomalies" and get a structured, actionable output instantly.

This means faster turnarounds, less human error, and more focus on **developing and refining your custom loaders** - not wrestling with a dozen different GUIs.

# So whatâ€™s different from another PE parser?

This isnâ€™t just *another* PE header dumper.
Most PE parsers (like pefile-based scripts or GUI tools such as PE-bear) focus on structural inspection - they tell you what is in the binary, but they donâ€™t make strong judgments or connect the dots for malware development and red team OPSEC.

MalDev Analyzer MCP was built by red teamers for red teamers, so it layers threat-oriented heuristics on top of normal PE parsing.

Instead of only printing imports and sections, it:
- Correlates IAT vs. runtime strings to uncover IAT hiding & dynamic API resolution.
- Classifies sections using known baselines, and flags anomalies or packer indicators (e.g., .upx, .rsrc2, .textbss).
- Detects real-world malicious traits like:
- AMSI/ETW patch patterns
- C2 framework indicators (Sliver, Cobalt Strike, Mythic, etc.)
- RWX / executable-writable section mapping (shellcode-friendly regions)
- TLS callbacks (stealth loader entrypoints)
- Embedded shellcode or encrypted blobs in .rsrc
- Suspicious API usage, even when not imported directly

Performs contextual scoring instead of raw dumping, so you immediately know whether a finding is benign-looking, suspicious, or likely malicious.
The goal is to bridge the gap between "generic PE analysis" and practical OPSEC testing for loader and implant development - all inside an MCP workflow, without bouncing between multiple GUIs or command-line tools.
