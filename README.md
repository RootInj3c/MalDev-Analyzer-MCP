# MalDev Analyzer MCP

**Built for red teamers, by red teamers** â€” an MCP-powered assistant for malware development, OPSEC testing, and custom loader design during red team engagements.

MalDev Analyzer MCP is designed to help offensive security professionals and malware developers quickly evaluate Windows binaries for traits that may impact stealth, functionality, or OPSEC. Whether youâ€™re building a loader, refining an implant, or validating payload security posture, this tool provides fast, targeted insights.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **MCP Integration** â€“ Works with the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to interact directly with compatible AI assistants like Cursor.
- **Binary Trait Analysis** â€“ Identify patterns common in real-world malware and red team tooling.
- **OPSEC Checks** â€“ Spot traits that could raise detection risk during engagements.
- **Custom Loader Support** â€“ Designed with loader development workflows in mind.

## ðŸ›  Included Analysis Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **File Hashing** | Compute SHA-256 and MD5 hashes for quick identification. |
| **String Extraction** | Extract top ASCII/UTF-16 strings to quickly surface suspicious terms. |
| **Suspicious API Detection** | Flag WinAPI calls often used in malware development. |
| **C2 Framework Indicators** | Detect known C2 framework names embedded in binaries. |
| **Section Analysis** | Identify unusual or risky PE section names. |
| **Shannon Entropy** | Detect high-entropy data that may indicate encryption/packing. |
| **Import Table (IAT) Analysis** | Compare declared imports to discovered API usage to spot hiding/obfuscation. |
| **Export Table Analysis** | Highlight exports with suspicious keywords or patterns. |
| **PE Metadata analyzer** | Extract basic file metadata for further profiling. |

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher with installed dependencies
- MCP Client (Tested with Cursor IDE)

## ðŸš€ Quick Installtion

### 1. Install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RootInj3c/MalDev-Analyzer-MCP.git
cd MalDev-Analyzer-MCP
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure in MCP Client
Add to your MCP servers JSON (or equivalent MCP client config):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "maldev-analyzer": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["PATH/TO/maldev_analyzer.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Example MCP Queries
**Example queries you can ask through the MCP:**
- "Scan this file for suspicious API calls and potential IAT hiding"
- "Check this binary for section anomalies or known packer signatures"
- "Analyze this loader for C2 indicators and hardcoded framework names"
- "Extract the top suspicious strings from this executable"
- "Perform export table analysis on this file"
- "Check file hashes and entropy score"
- "Identify any suspicious persistence or injection-related APIs"
- "Run full OPSEC analysis on this loader for red team use"
